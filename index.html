   Variables: a name used to store  data. we first declare the 
   variable by user var,let,or const. Then we give it a name. 
   never we use the assignment operator =, followed by the data we want to use.
ex: let name = "bob";

we can wriite mutiple variable with one declration using comma
let name = "bob", age = 30; 

**NOTE: using let with show and error if a variable is triggers twice
      let msg = "hi";
      let msg = "no";
      console.log(msg); !ERROR

      **NOTE:
-The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
-The first character must not be a digit.
-When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used. ex: myVeryLongName

**NOTE: There are a reserved name like let,const,var, return, etc... that are functions built-in.
-using const variable cannot be reassigned

console.log() good way to debugg and test code

      /* 
      Other complex assignment operators


+= addition assignment - adds the value on the variable on the left, then returns the new variable
x=5
ex: x += 3 same as  x = x + 3;
value = 8;

-= subtraction assignment - subtracts the value on the variable on the left, then returns the new variable
x=5
ex: x -= 3 same as  x = x - 3;
value = 2;

*= multiplication assignment - multiples the variable on the left by the value on the right, and returns the new variable value.
x=5
ex: x *= 3 same as  x = x * 3;
value = 15;

/= division assignment - divides the variable on the left by the value on the right, and returns the new variable value.
x=5
ex: x /= 3 same as  x = x / 3;
value = 1.666666666667;

      /* 
Comparison operators 

=== strict equality tests wether the left and right values are identical to one another

!== Strict non equality  tests whether the left and right values are Not identical to one another

< Less than tests if the left value is less than the right value
> greater than  tests to see if the left values is greater than the right value
<= Less Than or equal to  - tests whether the left value is smaller than or equal to the right value
>= Greater than or equal to -tests whether the left value is greater thab or equal to the right value

These are great boolean options, which are great for desicsion making.  two values: true and false
